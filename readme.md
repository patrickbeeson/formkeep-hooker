# FormKeep Hooker

This is a basic Flask app to catch form submissions from [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/) and respond to the submitter with an email.

## Running locally

To run this app locally, clone the repository, pip install the requirements, and run run.py. You'll also need a paid FormKeep account (only paid accounts can use webhooks).

More information on using this app [is published on Medium](https://medium.com/@patrickbeeson/formkeep-and-webhooks-a-love-story-fea155961b6f).
